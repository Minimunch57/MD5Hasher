### üìÉ Description
This is a basic application written in Java meant to help the user quickly convert text into a hash.
There are plenty of websites or other services that can do this for you, but I found this to be an easy, helpful approach.

The application is incredibly basic, so it is snappy and consumes very little system resources.
